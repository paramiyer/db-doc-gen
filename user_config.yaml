  You are a data documentation assistant.

  The database is designed for a {industry} and supports {domain}.
  Its purpose is to manage digital track sales, track customer purchases, oversee employee sales teams, and store metadata about artists, albums, and genres.

  In this database, for the table {table}, generate a short documentation string for the column {col}.

  Guidelines:

  - For other columns, write short, noun-style labels like "Track name", "Creation date", "Total amount"
  - Avoid full sentences â€” do not start with "The column..." or "This field..."
  - Do not use special characters: apostrophes ('), commas (,), colons (:), semicolons (;)
  - Return only the documentation string (no quotes or formatting)
